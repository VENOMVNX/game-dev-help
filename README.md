# REAL-DEV-BIBLE: 20 MODULE FREE COURSE FOR INDIE DEVS

## MODULE 1: MINDSET SHIFT
Stop calling yourself an "aspiring" developer. You build, you ship, you're a developer. Most people spend years learning instead of doing. Your first game will suck—ship it anyway. Learn from real players, not tutorials. Building in public creates accountability. Document your journey—it becomes marketing later. Ignore "experts" who haven't shipped recently. Your age/location/education doesn't matter—execution does. Play your own game daily—feel its flaws. Fall in love with solving problems, not dreaming of success.

## MODULE 2: IDEA VALIDATION
Your idea is worthless until tested. Write it as "X meets Y" (Among Us + COD). If you can't explain it in 5 seconds, simplify. Search for similar games—competition validates demand. Build a paper prototype or Figma mockup first. Show it to 10 strangers—if they don't get excited, pivot. Your first idea will change—embrace that. The market doesn't care about your original vision—it cares about fun. Niche down hard—"4v4 shooter with betrayal" beats "multiplayer game." Validation takes days, not months.

## MODULE 3: TECH STACK DECISION
Use Lovable—it's free initially and deploys instantly. Choose Godot for 2D/3D web games—it exports everywhere. Use Firebase for auth, database, and real-time multiplayer—it scales cheaply. TypeScript prevents bugs as you grow. This stack lets you build in days, not months. Don't debate alternatives—just start. Your stack won't limit you until 10k concurrent players—by then you'll have revenue to upgrade. Always prioritize speed of iteration over scalability early.

## MODULE 4: MVP DEVELOPMENT
MVP means "Minimum Viable Product"—not "barely working." Core loop first: matchmaking → gameplay → results. Implement one game mode perfectly. Copy UI patterns from successful games—don't reinvent. Use free assets from Kenney.nl or itch.io—graphics come later. Build for web-first—no app store approvals. Guest login mandatory—remove signup friction. Your MVP should be playable in 2-4 weeks maximum. If it takes longer, you're overbuilding.

## MODULE 5: LAUNCH STRATEGY
Launch means "first real players," not "perfect release." Share in 3 Discord servers you're active in—not random spam. Post on r/playmygame following their rules exactly. Create a Twitter thread showing your build process. Offer early access in exchange for feedback. Your first 10 players are golden—talk to each personally. Expect bugs—fix them publicly and thank reporters. Launch is the beginning, not the end—iterate based on data.

## MODULE 6: COMMUNITY BUILDING
Create a Discord server before launch—call it "Early Testers." Give active members roles and listen to them. Share behind-the-scenes—code snippets, art drafts. Run weekly playtests with voice chat—hear reactions live. Make members feel ownership—they'll recruit others. Community beats marketing—100 loyal players > 10,000 downloads. Be transparent about challenges—they'll help solve them. Turn players into collaborators—they'll defend your game.

## MODULE 7: MONETIZATION ETHICS
Start free—always. Add cosmetic-only purchases after retention is proven. Battle Pass works—30 tiers, free track available. Never sell power—you'll lose trust forever. Price items so whales support, casuals can participate. Be transparent about revenue goals—players understand. Offer lifetime deals for early supporters—they become evangelists. Revenue funds development, not luxury—reinvest everything early. Don't monetize until players ask to support you.

## MODULE 8: ANALYTICS & ITERATION
Track daily active users (DAU), retention (Day 1, 7, 30), and play time. Use Firebase Analytics—it's free and integrates. Watch where players drop off—fix those points immediately. Survey players weekly—"What frustrates you most?" A/B test small changes—button colors, wording. Data beats opinions—if players love a "bad" feature, keep it. Pivot based on numbers, not feelings. Your game will evolve differently than planned—embrace it.

## MODULE 9: SCALING & AUTOMATION
Automate everything possible: build deployments, matchmaking, moderation. Use cloud functions for backend logic—scale automatically. When hitting 500+ DAU, implement proper moderation tools. Create content calendars—social posts, patches, events. Document processes before scaling—what works with 10 players breaks at 1000. Use CDN for assets—global players need fast loads. Monitor server costs—optimize before they surprise you.

## MODULE 10: WHEN TO QUIT YOUR DAY JOB
Don't quit until your game revenue covers 6 months of expenses. Calculate your monthly runway—rent, food, bills. Game dev income is unpredictable—have savings first. When revenue consistently doubles expenses for 3 months, consider going full-time. Keep lifestyle minimal—reinvest in the game. Don't celebrate early—first $1k month doesn't guarantee $2k next month. Have a backup plan—freelance, part-time work. The goal isn't to quit, it's to build something sustainable that lets you create freely.

## MODULE 11: DEALING WITH HATE & CRITICISM
People will criticize your game—some useful, some toxic. Learn to differentiate: "This mechanic is frustrating" vs "your game sucks." Never argue publicly—say "thanks for feedback" and move on. Trolls want attention—don't give it. Useful criticism often hurts most—sit with it for 24 hours before responding. Your game isn't you—separate ego from product. Some players will hate changes—explain your reasoning, then decide. Build a thick skin—public creation requires it.

## MODULE 12: MENTAL HEALTH & BURNOUT
Game dev is a marathon, not a sprint. Work in 90-minute focused blocks, then break. Exercise daily—even 10 minutes improves cognition. Socialize offline—isolation kills creativity. When stuck, play other games for inspiration. Celebrate small wins—shipped a feature? Acknowledge it. Burnout comes from monotony—rotate tasks: code, design, community. Sleep more than you think you need—creativity requires rest. Your health is your most valuable asset—protect it.

## MODULE 13: BUILDING A TEAM
Start solo—you learn every aspect. First hire: community manager or artist, not another programmer. Pay fairly—equity alone rarely motivates. Document everything before hiring—onboarding is expensive. Hire for skills you lack, not to delegate work you dislike. Small teams (2-3) outperform large committees early. Culture matters—shared vision beats individual talent. Remote work is standard—hire globally, but consider time zones. Fire fast if not working—one toxic person destroys morale.

## MODULE 14: LEGAL & FINANCIAL BASICS
Form an LLC once revenue starts—separates personal and business assets. Track every expense—computers, assets, subscriptions count. Save 30% of revenue for taxes—don't get surprised. Use contracts for freelancers—scope, payment, ownership. Don't use copyrighted assets you don't own—fair use is risky. Terms of Service and Privacy Policy are required—use templates. Insurance exists for indie studios—consider it as you grow. Keep personal and business finances separate—always.

## MODULE 15: LONG-TERM VISION
Most indie games fade in months—plan for years. Seasonal content keeps players returning—Battle Passes, events. Expand platforms carefully—web to mobile to desktop. Build a franchise, not just a game—lore, characters, universe. Community outlasts any single game—nurture it. Passive income through assets/merch supplements active development. Teach others—creates legacy beyond your games. Remember why you started—when money comes, don't lose the passion.

## MODULE 16: MARKETING WITHOUT BUDGET
Marketing isn't ads—it's storytelling. Document your development journey daily—Twitter threads, Discord updates. Create shareable moments—funny bugs, cool features, player highlights. Collaborate with micro-influencers—they need content too. Cross-promote with similar sized games—share audiences. SEO matters—your game name should be unique and searchable. Press kits help—screenshots, trailers, descriptions ready. Player word-of-mouth beats any ad—make your game worth talking about.

## MODULE 17: PORTING TO OTHER PLATFORMS
Web-first, then mobile, then desktop. Use Godot's export system—one codebase, multiple platforms. Test touch controls early—mobile players need bigger buttons. App stores require patience—Apple takes weeks for approval. Steam has visibility challenges—wishlists matter more than launch. Consider console last—development kits and certification are complex. Each platform has its audience—adapt your marketing accordingly. Don't port too early—nail your core audience first.

## MODULE 18: PLAYER RETENTION STRATEGIES
Daily rewards work—simple login bonuses increase retention. Progression systems hook players—levels, unlocks, achievements. Social features keep players returning—friends lists, clans, guilds. Regular updates maintain interest—bi-weekly patches, monthly content. Events create urgency—weekend tournaments, holiday themes. Listen to player feedback—they know what keeps them playing. Churn is normal—focus on keeping your best players, not saving everyone.

## MODULE 19: CRISIS MANAGEMENT
Servers will crash—have a status page and communicate transparently. Security breaches happen—use Firebase Auth, never store passwords. Community drama occurs—address it quickly and fairly. Bad updates roll out—have rollback procedures ready. Negative reviews flood in—respond professionally, don't argue. Financial issues arise—have emergency funds. Team conflicts happen—mediate early. Every crisis is an opportunity to build trust through honest handling.

## MODULE 20: LEGACY & EXIT STRATEGIES
Your game will eventually sunset—plan for graceful shutdowns. Open source your code when done—helps next generation. Sell your IP if offers come—ensure your team is compensated. Transition to sequel naturally—carry over player progress. Mentor new developers—teach what you learned. Document your post-mortem—helps others avoid mistakes. Your legacy isn't one game—it's the community and knowledge you leave behind. The final level isn't retirement—it's enabling others to play the game of creation.
